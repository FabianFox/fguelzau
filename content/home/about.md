# Biography

I am a researcher at the Department of Social Sciences at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin. My research interests include (global) social inequality and family sociology. In my research, I like to use the R software environment and approaches from the toolkit of computational social sciences such as topic models, webscraping and network analysis.

In my PhD thesis, I analyzed current 'Leitbilder' (normative ideals) of 'good parenting' and their relation to social inequality. I used both classical surveys and newer sources of social research such as online discussion forums. The results have been published in a series of papers in the [European Early Childhood Education Research](https://fguelzau.netlify.app/publication/unequal-from-the-start_2018/), the [Journal of Family Research](https://fguelzau.netlify.app/publication/playground-chatter-on-the-internet/) and [European Policy Analysis](https://fguelzau.netlify.com/publication/paradigm-shift-family-policy_2020/). 

Currently, I work on questions regarding the global regulation of individual mobility by states. I am particularly interested in territorial borders and visa regulations. This research is part of an ongoing project at the CRC 1265 ["Re-Figuration of Spaces"](https://sfb1265.de/en/).   

With my colleagues at the chair of macrosociology I also collaborate on projects addressing changes in the structure of social inequality. My understanding of social inequality is a broad one that includes questions regarding the way individuals perceive objective social inequality but also the regulation of mobility rights through states.
