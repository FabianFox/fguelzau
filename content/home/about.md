# Biography

I am a researcher at the Department of Social Sciences at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin. My research interests include (global) social inequality and family sociology. In my research, I like to use the R software environment and approaches from the toolkit of computational social sciences such as topic models and webscraping.

In my PhD thesis, I analyze current 'Leitbilder' (normative ideals) of 'good parenting' and their relation to social inequality. I use both classical surveys and newer sources of social research such as online discussion forums. 

With my colleagues at the chair of macrosociology I also collaborate on projects addressing changes in the structure of social inequality. My understanding of social inequality is a broad one that includes questions regarding the way individuals perceive objective social inequality but also the regulation of mobility rights through states.
