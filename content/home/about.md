# Biography

I am a researcher at the The Expert Council on Integration and Migration in Berlin. My research interests include migration sociology and (global) social inequality. In my research, I like to use the R software environment and approaches from the toolkit of computational social sciences such as topic models, webscraping and network analysis. 

Currently, I work on polarization and attitudes towards migration in Germany. In addition, my research interests include 
questions regarding the global mobility regime (in particular, territorial borders and visa regulations). 

In my PhD thesis, I analyzed current 'Leitbilder' (normative ideals) of 'good parenting' and their relation to social inequality. I used both classical surveys and newer sources of social research such as online discussion forums. The results have been published in a series of papers in the [European Early Childhood Education Research](https://fguelzau.netlify.app/publication/unequal-from-the-start_2018/), the [Journal of Family Research](https://fguelzau.netlify.app/publication/playground-chatter-on-the-internet/) and [European Policy Analysis](https://fguelzau.netlify.com/publication/paradigm-shift-family-policy_2020/). 

In sum, my understanding of social inequality is a broad one that includes questions regarding the way individuals perceive objective social inequality but also the regulation of mobility rights through states.
