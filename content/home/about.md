# Biography

I am a researcher at "The Expert Council on Integration and Migration" in Berlin. My research interests include migration sociology and (global) social inequality. In my research, I like to use the R software environment and approaches from the toolkit of computational social sciences such as topic models, webscraping and network analysis. 

Currently, I work on polarization and attitudes towards migration in Germany. My research interests also include 
global mobility regimes (in particular, territorial borders and visa regulations) and citizenship studies. My 
understanding of social inequality is a broad one that includes questions regarding the way individuals 
perceive objective social inequality but also the regulation of mobility rights through states. 

My research has been published in the [Journal of Ethnic and Migrations Studies](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1369183X.2015.1005007?journalCode=cjms20), [International Migration](https://fguelzau.netlify.app/publication/regional-mobility-spaces/), and [Applied Geography](https://fguelzau.netlify.com/publication/border-regions-across-the-globe_2023/).
