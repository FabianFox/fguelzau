Currently, I do not have teaching obligations. However, I regularly organize workshops 
on webscraping, text mining and visualization with R. 

For an overview of my teaching portfolio see my homepage at the chair of macrosociology [link](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/lehrbereiche-en/makro-en/mitarbeiter-en/Guelzau?set_language=en).
