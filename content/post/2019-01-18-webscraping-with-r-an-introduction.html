<p>Recently, I was invited by <a href="https://www.wiso.uni-hamburg.de/en/fachbereich-sozoek/professuren/lohmann/team/lohmann-henning.html">Prof. Dr. Henning Lohmann</a> to talk about “Webscraping with R” at the Department of Socioeconomics (University of Hamburg, UHH). Among other things, I discussed the perils and promises of digital research, the infrastructure of the web, and how to implement a webscraping project using R.</p>
<p>The (German) slides are available below. After the presentation, the participants and I dug into several examples, which I also made available on my <a href="https://github.com/FabianFox/Webscraping-Hamburg-">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks for the invitation and the warm welcome in Hamburg!</p>
