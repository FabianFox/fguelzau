[Simon Munzert](https://simonmunzert.github.io/) and [Johannes Himmelreich](https://johanneshimmelreich.net/) 
organized a wonderful workshop on "Teaching Data Science for Non-Data Scientists and Data Ethics for Non-Ethicists" on the 19/20 August 2021. The [workshop program](/pdf/datascienceethics.pdf) included several instigating presentations. 

I presented some preliminary thoughts on webscraping and (data) ethics. The tentative insights mainly
came from several workshops that I gave. The slides are available below:
