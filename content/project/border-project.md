Since April 2018, I started working on a project entitled 'The Borders of the World: Processes of the De- and Rebordering in a Global Perspective'. The projects intends to gather information on processes of border fortification at a global scale. 

Further information is available on the project's [website](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/lehrbereiche-en/makro-en/forschung-en/projekte-en/sfb-tp-c01).
