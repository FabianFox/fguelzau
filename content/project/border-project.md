Between 2018 and 2021, I worked with Steffen Mau and Kristina Korte on territorial borders. The project
'The Borders of the World: Processes of the De- and Rebordering in a Global Perspective' was part of
the CRC 1265 "The Re-Figuration of Spaces". 

The project led to several publications such as a special issue published in [Historical Social Research]((https://fguelzau.netlify.app/publication/border-fortification_2021/)) and an article on
temporary border controls in the Schengen area (available in the [Journal of Borderlands Studies]((https://fguelzau.netlify.app/publication/temporary-border-controls_2021/))). 

Further information is available on the project  [website](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/lehrbereiche-en/makro-en/forschung-en/projekte-en/sfb-tp-c01).
