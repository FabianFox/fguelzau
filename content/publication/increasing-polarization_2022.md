abstract = "At the latest since the so-called migration and refugee crisis in 2015 and 2016, immigration has been regarded as an area of conflict in society that is becoming increasingly contested. While some groups promote a «welcoming culture« and experience migration as a social enrichment, opponents advocate border closures and see immigration as a cultural and economic threat. It is also argued that it is primarily the upper classes that advocate openness, whereas lower classes tend to have more critical attitudes toward migration. Our paper examines patterns of attitudes toward migration as well as the social structuring of these attitudes over time. We focus on different aspects of the migration issue: willingness to grant legal equality to migrants (inclusiveness), openness to close contact with migrants (social proximity), and negative judgments about migrants (migration stress). In addition, we use a class indicator based on the theoretical considerations of Andreas Reckwitz. The German General Social Survey (ALLBUS) of the years 1996, 2006 and 2016 serves as the data basis. No increasing polarization can be detected for any of the attitudinal dimensions. We also find hardly any systematic changes in the social structuring of attitudes."
